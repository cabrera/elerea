2.1.0 - 100718
* reimplemented the parametric variant in a way that doesn't require
  signals to carry the type of the parameter any more
* added the ability to extract the global input in the parametric
  variant

2.0.0 - 100718
* moved experimental branch to the top (version 1 went into legacy
  status)
* added the clocked variant

1.2.3 - 100131
* added externalMulti to handle events that can fire several times
  within a superstep
* added a cache to the noise signal for safety reasons, so it lives in
  SignalGen now

1.2.2 - 100115
* added noise signals and the getRandom primitive (using mersenne-random)

1.2.1 - 091204
* modified the &&@ and ||@ operators to short-circuit

1.2.0 - 091202
* added the delayed variant to the experimental branch
* renamed storeJust to (-->) in the experimental branch

1.1.0 - 091126
* added experimental branch with a cleaner semantics

1.0.0 - 090726
* completely renewed interface by introducing the SignalMonad

0.6.0 - 090507
* renamed Void to StartToken
* replaced restarter with the simpler and more versatile startTokens

0.5.0 - 090502
* changed names of internal constructors to match primitives better
* added restarter and (==>)
* removed the unused type synonym Time

0.4.0 - 090501
* added keepAlive
* made delay a primitive
* completely separated sampling and aging

0.3.0 - 090419
* documentation bug fixed: the latcher is not delayed
* added dot (Graphviz) converter

0.2.0 - 090412
* removed primitives time and stateless
* removed default delay on stateful combinators and added experimental
  cycle detection
* added some non-primitive combinators: delay, edge, comparisons,
  logic relations
* added signal instances for various numeric classes

0.1.0 - 090410
* first public version
